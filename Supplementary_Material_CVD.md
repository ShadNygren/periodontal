Discount rate
10
Report the discount rate(s) and reason chosen.

Selection of outcomes
11
Describe what outcomes were used as the measure(s) of benefit(s) and harm(s).

Measurement of outcomes

Valuation of outcomes
13
Describe the population and methods used to measure and value outcomes.

Measurement and valuation of resources and costs
14
Describe how costs were valued.

Currency, price date, and conversion
15
Report the dates of the estimated resource quantities and unit costs, plus the currency and year of conversion.

Rationale and description of model
16
If modelling is used, describe in detail and why used. Report if the model is publicly available and where it can be accessed.

Analytics and assumptions
17
Describe any methods for analysing or statistically transforming data, any extrapolation methods, and approaches for validating any model used.

Characterising heterogeneity
18
Describe any methods used for estimating how the results of the study vary for subgroups.

Characterising distributional effects
19
Describe how impacts are distributed across different individuals or adjustments made to reflect priority populations.

Characterising uncertainty
20
Describe methods to characterise any sources of uncertainty in the analysis.

Approach to engagement with patients and others affected by the study
21
Describe any approaches to engage patients or service recipients, the general public, communities, or stakeholders (such as clinicians or payers) in the design of the study.

Results



Study parameters
22
Report all analytic inputs (such as values, ranges, references) including uncertainty or distributional assumptions.

Summary of main results
23
Report the mean values for the main categories of costs and outcomes of interest and summarise them in the most appropriate overall measure.

Effect of uncertainty
24
Describe how uncertainty about analytic judgments, inputs, or projections affect findings. Report the effect of choice of discount rate and time horizon, if applicable.

Effect of engagement with patients and others affected by the study
25
Report on any difference patient/service recipient, general public, community, or stakeholder involvement made to the approach or findings of the study

Discussion



Study findings, limitations, generalisability, and current knowledge
26
Report key findings, limitations, ethical or equity considerations not captured, and how these could affect patients, policy, or practice.

Other relevant information



Source of funding
