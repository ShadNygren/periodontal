**Target Journal**: Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation

**Date Created**: 2026-01-07

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Submission)

### 1. Figure Path Errors
- [ ] **Fix figure references in CVD_Paper.md**
  - Current: `images/figure_1.png` (lines 116, 121, 135, 140)
  - Actual location: `images CVD/figure_1.png`
  - **Options**:
    - Option A: Rename folder from "images CVD" to "images"
    - Option B: Update all 4 figure paths in manuscript
  - **Affected lines**: 116, 121, 135, 140

### 2. Document Separation Required
- [ ] **Split CVD_Paper.md into separate submission files**
  - Create `CVD_Cover_Letter.doc` (lines 17-27)
  - Create `CVD_Manuscript.doc` (lines 29-291)
  - Create `CVD_Supplementary_Materials.doc` (lines 292-507)
  - **Note**: Check journal requirements for file format (.doc vs .docx vs .pdf)

### 3. CHEERS 2022 Checklist Incomplete
- [ ] **Complete the "Location where item is reported" column** (lines 294-336)
  - Fill in page/section numbers for all 28 checklist items
  - Examples:
    - Item 1 (Title): "Page 1, Title"
    - Item 2 (Abstract): "Page 1, Lines XX-XX"
    - Item 3 (Background): "Page 2, Background section"
  - Reference the final paginated manuscript

### 4. Title Formatting Error
- [ ] **Fix title formatting** (line 1)
  - Current: "Cost-effectiveness analysis of non-surgical periodontal treatment for preventing strokes and myocardial infarctions in the U****nited ****K****ingdom**"
  - Should be: "Cost-effectiveness analysis of non-surgical periodontal treatment for preventing strokes and myocardial infarctions in the United Kingdom"

## MAJOR ISSUES (Important for Quality)

### 5. Reference Verification
- [ ] **Check reference 47 usage** (lines 146, 282)
  - Line 146: "the cost-effectiveness of NSPT compares unfavourably with well-established CVD prevention methods [47]"
  - Line 282: Reference 47 is "Mihaylova B, et al. Lifetime effects and cost-effectiveness of standard and higher-intensity statin therapy..."
  - Verify this citation is appropriate for both contexts or if reference 48 should be used instead

### 6. Supplementary Table Cross-References
- [ ] **Verify supplementary table numbering**
  - Line 65: References "Supplementary Material Table 3" (transition probabilities)
  - Line 77: References "Supplementary Material Table 2" (parameters)
  - Current supplementary tables are numbered 1-6
  - Confirm these references match the actual table numbers

### 7. Missing Reference [29]
- [ ] **Check reference 29 citation** (line 62)
  - Text states: "There have been no randomised controlled trials or long-term cohort studies testing the effect of NSPT on preventing CVD events within a UK population [29]"
  - Reference 29: "Sanz M, et al. Periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases: consensus report"
  - Verify this is the appropriate citation for this statement

## MINOR ISSUES (Polish and Formatting)

### 8. Formatting Inconsistencies in References
- [ ] **Fix reference formatting errors**
  - Line 282: "Eur** J Prev Cardiol" - remove extra asterisks
  - Line 498: "MDM Policy **Pract" - fix asterisk placement
  - Review all references for consistent formatting

### 9. Abbreviations
- [ ] **Verify all abbreviations are defined at first use**
  - CHD: Defined at line 44 ✓
  - PD: Defined at line 45 ✓
  - NSPT: Defined at line 45 ✓
  - MI: Defined at line 49 ✓
  - QALY: Defined at line 49 ✓
  - CVD: Defined at line 43 ✓
  - PSA: Needs verification of first use
  - NHS: Defined at line 43 ✓

### 10. Supplementary Table 4 Clarity
- [ ] **Add methodology note to Table 4** (line 401-409)
  - Explain how "Expected amount per cycle" was determined
  - Consider adding a footnote or brief description
