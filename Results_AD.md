We estimate that there will be approximately XXX individuals formally diagnosed with dementia in England in 2040, with XX% of these being exposed to PD before dementia onset, at a baseline PD prevalence of 50%. For our best-case scenario of 25%, dementia prevalence for 2040 is projected to reach XX, with XX% with PD. For our worst-case scenario of 75%, dementia prevalence for 2040 is projected to reach XX, with XX% with PD. 
A 50% fall in PD is projected to lead to a reduction of XXX dementia cases. This will result in XXX saved in costs to the NHS, and XXX total QALYs saved.

Our PSA revealed similar results to our base cases. 

The dementia burden will increase substantially over time regardless of the PD prevalence, but its clear that increases in PD will lead to greater multimorbidity in individuals with dementia.
