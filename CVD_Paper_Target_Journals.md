## AUTHOR RECOMMENDATIONS

### STRONGLY RECOMMEND:
**Start with Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation**

**Reasons**:
1. ✅ Perfect scope alignment
2. ✅ You already drafted cover letter for this journal
3. ✅ Fast editorial decision (10 days)
4. ✅ Reasonable costs with waiver options
5. ✅ Appropriate impact factor for first health economics publication
6. ✅ Open access ensures wide readability
7. ✅ Receptive to methodological uncertainty discussions
8. ✅ NHS perspective welcomed

### PREPARE BACKUP PLAN:
Have manuscript ready for resubmission to:
- **Applied Health Economics and Health Policy** (if methodological issues raised)
- **BMC Public Health** (if broader scope suggested)

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Start with ultra-high impact journals (e.g., Lancet, BMJ) - wrong scope
- ❌ Submit to pure clinical journals without health services research section
- ❌ Submit to journals focused only on RCTs (your study is modeling-based)

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

### Open Access Considerations
Most health economics journals are moving to open access or hybrid models. Consider:
- Your institution's open access policy
- Funder requirements (if any)
- Budget for APCs (~£2,000-4,500)
- BMC journals offer waivers for some countries

### Preprint Options
Consider posting preprint on:
- **medRxiv** (medical/health sciences) - https://www.medrxiv.org/
- **Research Square** - https://www.researchsquare.com/
- **SSRN** (health economics papers) - https://www.ssrn.com/

Benefits:
- ✓ Establishes priority
- ✓ Gets feedback
- ✓ Increases visibility
- ✓ Many journals allow preprints

### Other Considerations
1. **Check journal requirements** for:
   - Word count limits
   - Figure limits (you have 4 figures, 5 tables in main text, 6 in supplement)
   - Supplementary material policies
   - Data sharing requirements

2. **Suggested reviewers**: Prepare list of 3-5 potential reviewers:
   - UK health economists
   - Periodontal health services researchers
   - CVD prevention economists
   - Exclude: collaborators, same institution, conflicts

3. **Exclusions**: Prepare list of opposed reviewers if any conflicts exist
